This is the first project I done 

with the "Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program" at Udacity (https://www.udacity.com/).


For this project, I combined my HTML and CSS skills to recreate a web page from a design prototype.

Also, I put my knowledge and creativity to use as I style a web page to simulate a training card that features an animal that I chose.

I chose a Frilled-neck lizard here.


I tried to resemble the theme of National Geographic (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/).
