		<div class="information">
			<div class="interesting">The creators of Jurassic Park were inspired by the Frilled Lizard when they designed their version of Dilophosaurus, the spitting dinosaur. <br><br>
			But we don't know if Dilophosaurus had a frill, and the Frilled Lizard doesn't have venom, much less spit it.

			<div class="description">
				The frill-necked lizard is a relatively large member of the agamid family, growing up to 2.79 ft. <br><br>
				It is capable of bipedal locomotion and has been described as regularly moving in this manner with a purposeful stride at times by naturalists. <br><br>
				The most distinct feature of these lizards is the large ruff of skin which usually lies folded back against its head and neck. The neck frill is supported by long spines of cartilage which are connected to the jaw bones. <br><br>
				When the lizard is frightened, it produces a startling deimatic display: it gapes its mouth, exposing a bright pink or yellow lining; it spreads out its frill, displaying bright orange and red scales; raises its body; and sometimes holds its tail above its body.<br><br>
				This reaction is used for territorial displays, to discourage predators, and during courtship.
